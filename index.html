        <p>Hello my name is Craig Parker Jr. a african American male and I am 26 years old.<br>
            People always ask me why am I single and I tell them because I'm living my best life currently at this moment.<br>
            I love hanging with my friends(because they are dope), going to the bar, and on occassions I like to go to the club to get litty.<br>
            It was one point in my life I would go to the mall every week to shop but once I start paying in bills my money was looking funny under light so I had to cut it out.<br>
            So the only thing I do now is go to the gym and get my pump going on because gym life.<br>
             </p>
