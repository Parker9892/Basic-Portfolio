        <p>
            Hello my name is Craig Parker Jr. a african American male and I am 26 years old.
            I was raised in DC in till I was 13 and then I move to fort washington, md with my father.
            At the time I lived with my grandmother. I always tell people I was raised in DC but I grew up in MD.
        The reason why I tell people that is because my foundation as a man is DC. 
        Most of my friends are still in DC even though I moved because I go back all the time and my family is still there.
        And honestly I dont see myself moving because to DC because moving to Maryland was the best decision that I ever made.


             </p>
               Things that I like to do on my free time. I love hanging with my friends when I can.
               I belive that all of my friends are built from the same cloth.
               We have the best group chat in the world and by far the most ignorant one.
               I could only imagine what would someone would think outside of my friend group seen our group chat.
